# SWQModding

A mod for the game SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.

## About this mod

I created this side project to change some game mechanics, add more synergetic cards, items, and status, and add more thematic builds and team combos.

I already played with the game assets and I have some scripts to edit them, but I did not create tools for editing. Also, I am relying on the Lua script side and some of the changes might need reverse engineering.

I am this for fun and with low priority, so it may have a slow pace. Check the [develop](https://github.com/EdikoCruz/SWQModding/tree/develop) branch to check it out.

## Installing

The scripts were made for Linux and tested with the GOG Version.

If the game folder is not `~/GOG Games/SteamWorld Quest Hand of Gilgamech/` create a .env file and specify the path.

to install run `./scripts/install.sh`, and to remove run `./scripts/remove.sh`.
