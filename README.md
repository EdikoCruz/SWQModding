# SWQModding

A mod for the game SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.

## About this mod

I created this side project to change some game mechanics, add more synergetic cards, items, and status, and add more thematic builds and team combos.

I already played with the game assets and I have some scripts to edit them, but I did not create tools for editing. Also, I am relying on the Lua script side and some of the changes might need reverse engineering.

I am doing this for fun and with low priority, so it may have a slow pace. Check the [develop](https://github.com/EdikoCruz/SWQModding/tree/develop) branch to check it out.
